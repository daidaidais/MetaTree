## Requirements
* Arduino
* Pulse Sensor <http://pulsesensor.com/>
* Pupil headset from Pupil Labs <https://pupil-labs.com/pupil/>
* Python (to get data from Pupil real time and to send it to Arduino via UDP)
* Kinect V2
* Visual Studio (I used Express 2012 for Desktop)
* Bio Metal Fiber <http://www.toki.co.jp/biometal/products/bmf/bmf.php>
* some transistors and resistors to increase electric current
* JINS MEME <https://jins-meme.com/>
* Unity (not necessary, but you can use the code here to visualize tree movement on screen too, usuing Procedural Tree from Wasabimole)
